shapool-core is an FPGA core for SHA256d mining (e.g. BTC) for use with
Lattice Semiconductor ICE40HX8K devices and the open-source Project IceStorm
toolchain (http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/).

The Lattice ICE40 FPGAs were developed for exteremely low power applications.
The purpose of this project is to evaluate their power usage and cost for
mining and produce an extremely low power miner.
